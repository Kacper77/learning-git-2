			<h1>Iron maiden</h1>
			<h4>Fear of the dark</h4>
			<p>I am a man who walks alone 
			And when I'm walking a dark road 
			At night or strolling through the park 
			When the light begins to change 
			I sometimes feel a little strange 
			A little anxious when it's dark 
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
			I have a constant fear that something's always near 
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
			I have a phobia that someone's always there</p>
