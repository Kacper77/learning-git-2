			<h1>Iron maiden</h1>
			<h4>Fear of the dark</h4>
			<p>I am a man who walks alone 
			And when I'm walking a dark road 
			At night or strolling through the park 
			When the light begins to change 
			I sometimes feel a little strange 
			A little anxious when it's dark<br> 
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
			I have a constant fear that something's always near 
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
			I have a phobia that someone's always there</p><br>
			<p>Have you run your fingers down the wall 
			And have you felt your neck skin crawl 
			When you're searching for the light? 
			Sometimes when you're scared to take a look 
			At the corner of the room 
			You've sensed that something's watching you<br> 
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
			I have a constant fear that something's always near
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
			I have a phobia that someone's always there</p><br>
			<p>Have you ever been alone at night 
			Thought you heard footsteps behind 
			And turned around and no one's there? 
			And as you quicken up your pace 
			You find it hard to look again 
			Because you're sure there's someone there<br> 
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
			I have a constant fear that something's always near
			Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
			I have a phobia that someone's always there </p>
